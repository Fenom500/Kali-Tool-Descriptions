# Kali-Tool-Descriptions
I am currently thinking about undertaking a new project. I would like to learn Kali Linux in order to understand more about cybersecurity.
I decided the best first step would be to read about the various tools that Kali offers in order to figure out where to start.
This project will be building a Python script that grabs the introductory paragraph about each tool from https://tools.kali.org/tools-listing and writes the output to a .txt file. The text file may or may not be formatted to improve readability.
